# json_wordlist
Wordlist in JSON format.

Original list parsed from here: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/download/current-version

Phrases are included with spaces replacing the original underscores.

The JSON keys = the words, values = an array of the different parts of speech that apply to the word.
